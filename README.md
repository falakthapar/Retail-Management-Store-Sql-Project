# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis-Sql-Project
In this project, I have considered a fictional retail supermarket “K-mart” situated in different cities across India. This supermarket is a fast growing supermarket due to their services and variety of items they provide under a single roof.

I have analysed the Database to get different insights which I have mentioned in the google doc file. 

In this project, I have used MySql workbench to execute my queries. Also, I have used google docs in order to present it.
