# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis-Sql-Project
XYZ Paints Inc. is a paint company that was recently launched in 2019. Since then, they have established their name in top tier 1 and 2 cities (slowly expanding to tier 3 cities as well). 

They have orders coming from household, industrial, and government sectors. In recent years, they are seeing quite a steady growth and would like to continue that in the future. 

I have worked on some of the pain points of the marketing team like consumer growth, lead conversions, etc. as well as on the new set of campaigns or doing market basket analysis. 

In this project, I have used MySql workbench to execute my queries. Also, I have used google docs in order to present it.
